# Why Your ChatGPT Output Sounds Mediocre (And How to Fix It)

Have you ever felt incredibly frustrated using ChatGPT?

You tried using it to write content, but the results were...

💤 Dull.  
🪫 Lifeless.  
🚫 Forgettable.  

You even typed:  
**“Make it sound better.”**

But after a while, you realized something important:

**The issue wasn't ChatGPT.  
The issue was *how* you prompted it.**

## Ordinary Prompts = Ordinary Results

I started experimenting with different prompt approaches—  
and the results were astonishing.

It felt like I had hired a professional copywriter.  
Eventually, I identified **7 powerful prompt formulas**.  
Now, I'm sharing them with you.
