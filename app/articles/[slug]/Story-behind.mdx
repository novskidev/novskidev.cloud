## The Idea

The idea for this app came from my daily life experiences. As an elementary school teacher, I often find myself helping people with both school-related matters and personal problems. While I may not be an expert, I genuinely enjoy helping others.

## People's Challenges

Over time, I've noticed that people come to me with unique problems, sometimes expecting that I can solve everything. However, I realized that some challenges need to be solved naturally, and solutions often need to be discovered by the individuals themselves.

## The Solution

In today's technologically advanced world, we have numerous apps to help solve our problems. I wanted to create something different - an app that's not only helpful but also accessible and free for everyone to use.

## The Apps

This is why I created [Mendingmana Apps](https://mendingmana-id.vercel.app). It's a website designed to help people with their decision-making process. Through Mendingmana, users can seek guidance about their problems, and the app provides them with tailored solutions, particularly focusing on choice-making and recommendations.

## The Future

My vision for Mendingmana Apps extends beyond its current capabilities. I aim to develop it further to be more useful and helpful, with a strong focus on improving user-friendliness and overall user experience.

## The End

Thank you for reading about the journey behind Mendingmana Apps. I look forward to helping more people make better decisions through this platform.
